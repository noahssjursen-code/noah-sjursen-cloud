# Agent Instructions

## Project Pattern

Each folder defining a module or service contains an `AGENTREADTHIS.md` file with instructions on what happens in that folder.

## Current Structure

- `dataplatform/iac/` - Infrastructure automation scripts
- `dataplatform/projects/reusables/` - Shared libraries

Read the `AGENTREADTHIS.md` in each folder for specific guidance.
